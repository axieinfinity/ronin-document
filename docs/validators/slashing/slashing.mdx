# Slashing

## Overview
Slashing is a mechanism that governs the behavior of validators on the Ronin blockchain.

Each validator is responsible for running two nodes: a validator node and
a bridge operator node. Validators are required to keep the nodes online and
up to date with the network, and to produce the correct block when it comes
to their turn.

If a validator is unavailable when needed or shows signs of malicious
behavior, they get penalized by having their stake or reward reduced,
or _slashed_, as follows:
* Reward slashing. Withholding rewards that the validator would've 
otherwise received.
* RON slashing. Charging a fixed amount of RON tokens from 
the validator's self-stake.

In addition, the validator may be temporarily or permanently banned
from the network, or _jailed_.

## Slashable cases

There are four groups of slashable cases on Ronin, where
the penalties described apply in combination.

### Double-sign validator

The case in which a validator signs more than one block with the same height.

The penalties are as follows:

* The validator is jailed for $2^{63}-1$ blocks and can't be a validator in the future. Their status is set to **In jail**.
* The validator gets slashed the minimum staking amount from their self-stake.
* The validator can't claim commission or staking rewards during jail time.

### Unavailability validator

The case in which a validator misses a certain number of blocks in a day. 
There are three tiers in this slash.

#### Tier 1 validator slashing

A validator misses their turn to produce blocks more than 50 times in a day.

The penalties are as follows:
* The validator can't claim commission or staking rewards on that day.
* The validator's status is set to **Punished**.

#### Tier 2 validator slashing

A validator misses their turn to produce blocks more than 150 times in a day.

The penalties are as follows:
* The validator is jailed for $\approx2$ days with the status set to **In jail**.
* The validator gets slashed 10,000 RON.
* The validator can't claim commission or staking rewards during jail time. 

The validator can [bail out](bailout.mdx) of jail if they have sufficient credit score.

#### Tier 3 validator slashing

A validator bails out of Tier 2 but misses their turn to 
produce blocks more than 50 times on the same day.

The penalties are as follows:
* The validator is jailed for $\approx2$ days with the status set to **In jail**.
* The validator gets slashed 10,000 RON.
* The validator can't claim commission or staking rewards during jail time.

At this tier, the validator can’t bail out.

### Unavailability bridge operator

The case in which a validator's bridge operator node misses a certain
number of votes. There are two tiers in this slash.

#### Tier 1 operator slashing

A bridge operator misses more than 10% of votes in a day.

The penalties are as follows:
* The corresponding validator can't claim bridge rewards on that day.
* The corresponding validator's status is set to **Punished**.

#### Tier 2 operator slashing

A bridge operator misses more than 20% of votes in a day.

The penalties are as follows:
* The corresponding validator can't claim any rewards (commission, staking rewards, bridge rewards) on that day.
* The corresponding  validator is jailed for $\approx2$ days with the status set to **In Jail**.

At this tier, the validator can’t bail out.

### Relaying slash

The case when a Governing Validator doesn’t sync the set of bridge operators
to the Ethereum chain for three consecutive days. 

The penalties are as follows:
* The validator is slashed 10,000 RON.
* The validator can't claim commission during this time.
* The validator's status is set to **Punished**.

### Multiple slashes

Validators might experience multiple concurrent slashes if they have issues
with both their validator node and bridge operator node, and the relaying
responsibilities of the Governing Validator.
