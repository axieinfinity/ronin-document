# Slashing rules

## Overview
Slashing is a mechanism that governs the behavior of validators on
the Ronin blockchain.

Each validator is responsible for running two nodes: a validator node
and a bridge operator node. Validators are required to keep the nodes
online and up to date with the network, and to produce the correct
block when it comes to their turn.

If a validator is unavailable when needed or shows signs of malicious
behavior, they get penalized by having their stake or reward reduced,
or _slashed_, as follows:
* Reward slashing. Withholding rewards that the validator would've 
otherwise earned.
* RON slashing. Charging a fixed amount of RON tokens from 
the validator's self-stake.
* The validator may be temporarily or permanently banned
from the network, or _jailed_.

Slashed RON go to back to the rewards pool, which is used to reward validators.

## Slashable cases
There are four groups of slashable cases on Ronin, where
the rules previously described apply in combination.

### Double-sign validator
It's a serious error when a validator signs more than one block with the same height.
Anyone can submit a slash request with the double-sign evidence, which
should contain the two block headers with the same height, sealed by
the same validator. Upon verifying the evidence, the offending
validator is slashed as follows:
* The validator is jailed for $2^{63}-1$ blocks and can't be a
validator in the future. Their status is set to **In jail**.
* The validator gets slashed the minimum staking amount of
self-delegated RON.
* The validator doesn't earn commission and staking rewards while in jail.

### Unavailability validator
The performance of Ronin relies on the ability of everyone in the
validator set to produce blocks on time when it's their turn.
If a validator misses their turn, it affects the performance of
the entire system. Thus, we implemented a mechanism that penalizes
validators who miss too many blocks.

We use a smart contract to record the number of missed blocks for each
validator. If the number of missed blocks exceeds a predefined threshold,
the validator gets slashed.

#### Tier 1 validator slashing
If a validator misses more than 50 blocks a day, they don't earn
commission and staking rewards on that day, and their status is set to **Punished**.

#### Tier 2 validator slashing
If a validator misses more than 150 blocks a day, they get slashed
as follows:
* The validator doesn't earn commission and staking rewards on that day.
* The validator is slashed 10,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator is jailed for $\approx2$ days (57,600 blocks) and is
banned from the validator set while in jail.

The validator can [bail out](bailout.mdx) of jail if they have
sufficient credit score.

#### Tier 3 validator slashing
After being put in jail and getting bailed out, if the validator
misses 50 more blocks within the day, they get slashed as follows:
* The reward after bailing out is removed.
* The validator is slashed 10,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator is jailed for $\approx2$ days (57,600 blocks). 

This time, the validator can't bail out.

### Unavailability bridge operator
The system slashes bridge operators for not providing enough signatures.
There's a smart contract that records the number of the bridge operators' votes.
There are two tiers in this slash.

#### Tier 1 operator slashing
If a bridge operator misses more than 10% votes,
the corresponding validator doesn't earn bridge rewards on that day.

#### Tier 2 operator slashing
If a bridge operator misses more than 30% votes, 
the corresponding validator gets slashed as follows:
* The validator doesn't earn any rewards (commission,
staking rewards, bridge rewards) on that day.
* The validator is jailed for $\approx$ 2 days (57,600 blocks)
with no option to bail out.

### Relaying slash
If a Governing Validator doesnâ€™t sync the set of bridge
operators to the Ethereum chain for three consecutive days,
they get slashed as follows:
* The validator is slashed 10,000 of self-delegated RON.
* The validator doesn't earn commission on the day of slashing.
* The validator's status is set to **Punished**.

### Multiple slashes
Validators might experience multiple concurrent slashes if they have issues
with both their validator node and bridge operator node, and the relaying
responsibilities of the Governing Validator.
