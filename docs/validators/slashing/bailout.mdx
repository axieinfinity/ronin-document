# Bailout

## Overview

If you're in [tier 2 validator slashing](slashing.mdx), you can bail out
of jail at any time using your credit score.

The credit score is calculated as follows:
* All validators start with a 0 credit score.
* Every day, each validator (who is not in jail) is given 50 credits
if they miss no block. The validator loses 1 credit for every missed block.
* The maximum number of credits for a validator is 1,800.

## Check your credit score

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/)
and select **My Staking**. 
2. Find your credit score under **CREDIT SCORE**, next to your total
self-stake amount.

## Use credit score to bail out

It takes 5 credits to bail out for each epoch.

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/)
and select **My Staking**.
2. Locate the warning banner and click **Bail out**.

If you bail out on the same day you got slashed, you still receive 50%
of the block reward (commission and staking) from the time you bailed
out until the end of the day.
