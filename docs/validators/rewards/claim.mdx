# Claim rewards

## Claim commission and bridge rewards
Commission and bridge rewards are transferred to you automatically at the end of each period (roughly at the end of each day), so no action is required from your side.

## Claim staking rewards
Staking rewards are calculated each period (roughly equal to one day) and displayed as “claimable rewards”. You need to claim these rewards manually.

1. On the **My Staking** page, click **Claim all**.
