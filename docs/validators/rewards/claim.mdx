# Claim rewards

## Types of rewards
As a validator, you can earn three types of rewards:
* **Commission.** Reward derived from the block rewards times the commission rate.
* **Bridge reward.** Reward received for verifying transactions via Ronin Bridge. 
* **Staking reward.** Reward derived from your self-stake and divided proportionally with your delegators.

## Commission and bridge rewards
You don't need to claim commission and bridge rewards
because they are transferred to you automatically
in the end of each period (approximately one day). 

You can, however, keep track of these rewards under
**My Staking** > **Activities**.

## Staking reward
Staking reward is calculated each period (approximately one day)
and displayed as “claimable rewards”. 
You need to claim this reward manually.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
**My Staking** > **Claim all**.

3. Confirm the transaction.

After the transaction is confirmed, the reward is credited to your wallet.
