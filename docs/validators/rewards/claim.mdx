## Overview

This page describes how to claim your staking reward
and keep track of the commission and fast finality reward.
For information about rewards for validators, see
[Rewards](./../../basics/rewards.md).

## Staking reward

Staking reward is calculated each period (approximately one day)
and displayed as “claimable rewards”. 
You need to claim this reward manually.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
**My Staking** > **Claim all**.

2. Select **Claim now**.
<img src={stepTwo} width={400} />

3. Confirm the transaction.
<img src={confirmTransaction} width={400} />

After the transaction is confirmed, the reward is credited to your wallet.

## Commission and fast finality reward

You don't need to claim commission and fast finality reward
because they are transferred to you automatically
in the end of each period (approximately one day). 

You can, however, keep track of these rewards in
[Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
**My Staking** > **Activities**.
