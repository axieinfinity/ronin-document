# Types of rewards
As a validator, you can earn three types of rewards:
* **Bridge reward.** Reward received for verifying transactions via Ronin Bridge. 
* **Commission.** Reward derived from the block rewards times the commission rate.
* **Staking reward.** Reward derived from your self-stake and divided proportionally with your delegators.
