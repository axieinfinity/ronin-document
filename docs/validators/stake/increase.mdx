# Stake more
After becoming a validator, you can increase your self-stake of RON.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/) >
**My Staking** > **Stake more**.

2. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all available RON,
and then select **Stake**. The estimated reward is
calculated based on your estimated APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.

3. Confirm the transaction.

After the transaction is confirmed, you can review its details
on the **Activities** tab or check the status in
[Ronin Block Explorer](https://app.roninchain.com/dashboard).
