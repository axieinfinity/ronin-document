# Withdraw stake
You can withdraw part of your stake as long as three days have passed
since you last staked in, and provided that the minimum staking
amount is maintained after withdrawal.

:::caution
Withdrawing the stake might lower your chance of being selected
as a validator in the days after, depending on how much others
have staked.
:::

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com/) >
**My Staking** > expand the options > **Withdraw**.

entire stake, and then select **Withdraw**.

After the transaction is confirmed, you can review its details on the
**Activities** tab or check the status in
[Ronin Block Explorer](https://app.roninchain.com/dashboard).
