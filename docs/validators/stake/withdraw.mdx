# Withdraw stake
You can withdraw part of your stake to your wallet as long as itâ€™s been three days since you last staked in and provided that the minimum staking amount is maintained after withdrawal.

:::caution
Withdrawing a stake might lower your chance of being selected as a validator in the upcoming days, depending on how much others have staked.
