# Withdraw stake
You can withdraw part of your stake to your wallet as long as itâ€™s been
three days since you last staked in and provided that the minimum staking
amount is maintained after withdrawal.

:::caution
Withdrawing the stake might lower your chance of being selected
as a validator in the upcoming days, depending on how much others
have staked.
:::

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/)
