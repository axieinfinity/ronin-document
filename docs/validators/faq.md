# Validator FAQ
Here's a list of frequently asked questions.

### 1. After I register successfully as a Validator Candidate, what should I do next?
After [becoming](onboarding/become-validator.mdx) a Validator Candidate, thereâ€™s a chance that you get selected as a Standard Validator the next day. To avoid slashing, you need to make sure that your nodes are online and up to date, and the balance in your bridge operator node must be a minimum of 100 RON.

### 2. How to increase my chances of getting selected as a Standard Validator? 
The higher your total stake, the stronger your chance of becoming a Standard Validator because Ronin uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. You can attract more delegators by promoting your validator and maintaining good performance.

### 3. What are the most important performance metrics for a validator?
Your uptime, total staking amount, and APR (annual percentage rate).

### 4. What are the rewards for validators?
Validators receive fixed block rewards and transaction fees for producing blocks on Ronin. During the first year, validators also earn bridge rewards.

### 5. How can I become a Governing Validator?
This is done by [submitting](governance/create.mdx) a proposal. Any existing Governing Validator can propose to add another Governing Validator. If the proposal receives enough votes, the proposed validator becomes a Governing Validator.

### 6. How can I get support?
Join our validator channel on Discord after registering as a Validator Candidate.
