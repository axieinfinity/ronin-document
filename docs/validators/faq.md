# Validator FAQ

Here's a list of most common questions.

### 1. After I register successfully as a Validator Candidate, what should I do next?
After [becoming](onboarding/become-validator.mdx) a Validator Candidate, there’s a chance that you get selected as a Standard Validator the next day. To avoid slashing, you need to make sure that your nodes are online and up to date, and the balance in your bridge operator address is at least 100 RON.

### 2. How to increase my chances of getting selected as a Standard Validator? 
Because Ronin uses DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, the higher your total stake is, the higher the chance to become a Standard Validator. You can get more delegators onboard by promoting your validator account and maintaining good performance.

### 3. What are the most important performance metrics for a validator?
Your uptime, total staking amount, and APR (annual percentage rate).

### 4. What are the rewards for validators?
By validating transactions on Ronin, you receive fixed block rewards together with transaction fees—in other words, it’s your commission and staking rewards. You also get bridge rewards in the first years as the incentive.

### 5. How can I become a Governing Validator?
This is done by [submitting](governance/create.mdx) a proposal. Any existing Governing Validator can propose to add another Governing Validator. If the proposal receives enough votes, the proposed validator becomes a Governing Validator.

### 6. How can I get support?
After registering as a Validator Candidate, join our validator channel on Discord.
