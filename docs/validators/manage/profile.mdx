If you’re a Standard Validator or a Validator Candidate, 
your profile has a set of three different addresses:
* **Admin address.** The address used to manage your profile, 
staking activities, and claiming rewards.
* **Validator address.** The address used for producing blocks. 
This address is displayed to delegators and also called “consensus address”.
* **Bridge operator address.** The address used for operating
[Ronin Bridge](https://bridge.roninchain.com/).

If you’re a Governing Validator, your profile has an additional 
two addresses:
* **Chain governor address.** The address used to 
[create proposals](./../governance/create.mdx) and
[vote](./../governance/vote.mdx) on changes.
* **Bridge voter address.** The address used for syncing
the set of bridge operators.
