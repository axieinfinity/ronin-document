If you’re a Standard Validator or a Validator Candidate, 
your profile has a set of the following addresses and details:

* **Admin address.** The address used to manage your profile, 
staking activities, and claiming rewards.
* **Validator address.** The address used for producing blocks. 
This address is displayed to delegators and also called “consensus address”.
* **Bridge operator address.** The address used for operating
[Ronin Bridge](https://bridge.roninchain.com/).
* **Bridge governor address.** The address used to vote on changes to the bridge, such as pausing the bridge or adding bridge operators.
* **Finality vote key.** This is the [cryptographic key](./../manage/fast-finality.md) used to vote
for blocks in the fast finality mechanism.

If you’re a Governing Validator, your profile has an additional address: 
**Chain governor address.** This address is used to 
[create proposals](./../governance/create.mdx) and
[vote](./../governance/vote.mdx) on changes to the validator set.
