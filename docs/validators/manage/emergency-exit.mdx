If you discovered that your node is compromised, such as when your private keys are stolen, you may be under attack and at risk of [slashing](./../slashing.mdx). When you suspect that you're being targeted, you can request an emergency exit to protect your node and prevent damage.

## Submit your request

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then select your account, and then click **Emergency exit**.

2. Agree to the terms and submit the request

3. Submit evidence of the attack to the Governing Validators in the [#validator-chat](https://discord.com/channels/930892666705694800/1090764739858153553) channel on Ronin Discord.

## Result

Based on the Governing Validators' vote on your proposal, your stake may be refunded as follows:

* If the proposal's approved, your entire self-stake is refunded: 50,000 RON is credited immediately, while the remaining amount is transferred to you the next day (00:00 UTC).
* If the proposal's not approved or expires, you're refunded the amount equal to your self-stake minus 50,000 RON. The amount is transferred to you after seven working days from the proposal's creation date.

After the emergency exit is complete, you'll no longer be able to confirm blocks on Ronin and receive rewards. Your status will be set to "Renounced."
