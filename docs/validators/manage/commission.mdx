When signing up as a validator on Ronin, you were asked to set a commission rate, which is the percentage of the block reward
you receive before distributing the rest to your delegators.

You can change the commission rate in your profile:

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then go to your account, and then click **Commission rate**.

2. Enter the new commission rate in the range of 0-20%, and set the date when it takes effect. This date must be at least seven days from now.

3. Confirm the change.

After you confirm the new rate, users will see a clock icon next to your current rate, indicating that a change is pending.
