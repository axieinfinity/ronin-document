## Overview

This page describes how to claim your staking rewards
and keep track of the commission and fast finality rewards.
For information about rewards for validators, see
[Rewards](./../../basics/rewards.md).

## Claim staking rewards

Staking rewards are calculated each period (approximately one day)
and displayed as “claimable rewards”. 
You need to claim this reward manually.

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then select
**My Staking**, and then click **Claim all**.

2. Click **Claim now**.

3. Confirm the transaction.
   <img src={confirmTransaction} width={400} />

After the transaction is confirmed, the rewards are credited to your wallet.

## Claim commission and fast finality rewards

You don't need to claim commission and fast finality rewards
because they are transferred to you automatically
at the end of each period (approximately one day). 

You can, however, keep track of these rewards in **Validator Dashboard >
My Staking > Activities.**
