2. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all available RON,
and then select **Stake**. The estimated reward is
calculated based on your estimated APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON returns from this stake.

After the transaction is confirmed, you can review its details
on the **Activities** tab or check the status in
[Ronin Block Explorer](https://app.roninchain.com/dashboard).

## Withdraw stake

You can withdraw part of your stake as long as three days have passed
since you last staked in, and provided that the minimum staking
amount is maintained after withdrawal.

:::caution
Withdrawing the stake might lower your chance of being selected
as a validator in the days after, depending on how much others
have staked.
