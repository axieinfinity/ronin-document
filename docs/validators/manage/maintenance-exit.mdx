If you took your node offline for maintenance but found that you can get back to normal operation sooner than expected, you can exit maintenance mode early. Likewise, if there's no longer a need to take your node offline, you can cancel any planned maintenance.

To exit maintenance mode early, open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then go to your account, and then click **Early Exit Maintenance**. You will resume block confirmation starting from the next epoch.
