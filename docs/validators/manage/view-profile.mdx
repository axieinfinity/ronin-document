If you’re a Standard Validator or a Validator Candidate, 
your profile contains the following addresses:

* **Admin address.** The address used to manage your profile and 
staking activities, and to claim rewards. You can change this address. For more information, see [Change your admin address](addresses.mdx#admin).
* **Validator address.** The address used for producing blocks. 
This address is displayed to delegators and also called “consensus address”.
* **Bridge operator address.** The address used for operating a bridge node.
* **Bridge governor address.** The address used to vote on changes to the bridge, such as pausing the bridge or adding bridge operators.
* **Finality vote key.** This is the [cryptographic key](finality.mdx) used to vote
for blocks in the fast finality mechanism. You can change this key. For more information, see [Change your finality vote key](finality.mdx#change).

If you’re a Governing Validator, your profile has an additional **Governing validator address,** used to 
[create and vote on proposals](./../governance/overview.mdx) and
for adding and removing other validators and updating smart contracts.
