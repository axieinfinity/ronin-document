When [registering](./../onboarding/become-validator.mdx) to become
a validator, you set a commission rateâ€”the percentage of the block reward
you receive before distributing the rest to your delegators.

You can change this commission rate in your profile.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
your account > **Commission rate**.

2. Enter the new commission rate in the range of 0-20%,
and set the date it takes effect.
This date must be at least seven days from today.

After you save the new rate, a clock icon is displayed next to the
current rate to indicate the upcoming change.
