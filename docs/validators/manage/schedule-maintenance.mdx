You can schedule when your node undergoes maintenance.
Maintenance can be scheduled by up to three validators at the same time. 
If you are having trouble scheduling maintenance, ask the other validators about their maintenance schedules.
After your current maintenance ends, you need to wait at least three days before scheduling another one.

1. Go to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com) >
your account > **Maintenance mode**.

2. Specify the maintenance duration in epochs. 
The valid duration is 3-144 epochs (from about 30 minutes to 24 hours), where 1 epoch equals 200 blocks.
You can choose from the valid start epoch, then decide on the end epoch.

3. After you submit the request, the system displays the status
and duration of the maintenance period.
