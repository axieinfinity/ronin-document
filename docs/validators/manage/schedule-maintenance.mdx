You can decide when to do maintenance on your node.
Up to three validators can plan to do maintenance at the same time.
If you're having trouble figuring out when to schedule yours, it might help to check in with the other validators and see when they're doing theirs.
Just remember, after you finish your current maintenance, you have to wait at least three days before you can schedule the next one.

1. Open the [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com), then select your account, and then click **Maintenance mode**.

2. Specify the maintenance duration in epochs. 
The valid duration is 3-144 epochs (from about 30 minutes to 24 hours), where 1 epoch equals 200 blocks.
You can choose from the valid start epoch, then decide on the end epoch.

3. After you submit the request, the system displays the status
and duration of the maintenance period. To cancel the maintenance, click **Cancel Schedule Maintenance**.

   You can also exit maintenance mode early and resume block confirmation from the next epoch. To do so, click **Early Exit Maintenance.**
