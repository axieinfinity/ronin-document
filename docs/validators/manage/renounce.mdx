# Renounce your role
You can request renunciation of your role as a validator. 
If you're a Standard Validator or Validator Candidate, 
follow this guide. If you’re a Governing Validator, contact 
the Sky Mavis team for renunciation.

1. Go to **My Staking**, expand the options, and select **Renounce**.

2. Read through the explanation and confirm your decision. Keep in mind
that you won’t be able to cancel or undo this action.

3. Click **Renounce** to submit the request.

After submission, you will need to wait for seven days for renunciation
to take effect. 
All the commission, bridge rewards, staking rewards and the remaining
self-stake will be transferred to you automatically on the date of
renunciation.

:::caution
Because your role remains active during the seven-day waiting period,
you're advised to keep your node online and up to date with the
network to avoid slashing.
