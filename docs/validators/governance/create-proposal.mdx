## Overview

This guide explains how to create a proposal through the example of
adding a new Governing Validator. Make sure that this validator has
already [registered](../onboarding/become-validator.mdx)
as a Validator Candidate.

## Create a proposal

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your chain governor address. The name of your role at the top
right corner is a sign that you used the correct address.
<img src={stepOne} width={1280} />
2. Select **Proposals** > **Add a proposal**.
<img src={stepTwo} width={1280} />

:::info
The system allows for only one active proposal at a time.
If you see an existing active proposal, you need to wait until it's
closed. If a proposal doesn't get enough votes within 14 days, it's
closed automatically.
:::

3. Select the type of proposal you want to create. For example, 
**Add new governing validator**.
<img src={stepThree} width={550} />

4. Provide the three addresses of the validator.
<img src={stepFour} width={497} />

5. Sign the transaction to submit the proposal.

Your proposal is now displayed on the **Ongoing** tab, and will remain
active until [voted on](vote-on-proposal.mdx) by the other Governing Validators or 
automatically close after 14 days.
