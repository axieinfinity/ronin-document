# Vote on a proposal
As a governor, you can vote on proposals created by other
Governing Validators.

A proposal's approval or rejection is determined by the following ratio:
* A proposal is approved if it receives the approval of at least 75%
of the Governing Validators.
* A proposal is rejected if at least 25% of the
Governing Validators reject it.

If a proposal is neither approved nor rejected within 14 days,
it is automatically closed.

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your chain governor address. The name of your role at the top
right corner is a sign that you used the correct address.
