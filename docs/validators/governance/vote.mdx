# Vote on a proposal
As a Governing Validator, you can vote on proposals created by the other Governing Validators.

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your *chain governor* addressâ€”the identifier of a Governing Validator.
The name of your role at the top right corner is a sign that
you used the correct address.

2. Select **Proposals**, and then choose **Approve** or **Reject**.

3. Confirm your decision and sign the transaction.

The proposal is approved if at least 75% Governing Validators approve it, or rejected if at least 25% Governing Validators reject it.
If the proposal is neither approved nor rejected after 14 days, the system closes it automatically.
