# Vote on a proposal
As a Governing Validator, you can vote on proposals created by the other Governing Validators.

## Voting ratio
* A proposal is approved if at least 75% of the Governing Validators approve it.
* A proposal is rejected (and closed) if at least 25% of the Governing Validators reject it.
* A proposal that is neither approved nor rejected within 14 days is automatically closed.

## Cast your vote
1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
with your *chain governor* addressâ€”the identifier of a Governing Validator.
The name of your role at the top right corner is a sign that
you used the correct address.
