## Overview

This guide explains how to create and vote on proposals as a Governing Validator.

A proposal's approval or rejection is determined by the following ratio:
* A proposal is approved if it receives the approval of at least 70%
of the Governing Validators.
* A proposal is rejected if at least 30% of the
Governing Validators reject it.

After a proposal is approved, it is executed. If a proposal is neither approved nor rejected within 14 days,
it is automatically closed.

## Create a proposal

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your chain governor address.
2. Select **Proposals > Add a proposal**.

    :::info
    The system allows for only one active proposal at a time.
    If you see an existing active proposal, you need to wait until it's
    closed. If a proposal doesn't get enough votes within 14 days, it's
    closed automatically.

3. Select the type of proposal you want to create.

Your proposal is now displayed on the **DPOS proposals** tab, pending a vote.
