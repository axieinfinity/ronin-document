# Governance
Governing Validators can make changes to the network through an on-chain governance process.

To effect a change, a Governing Validator submits a proposal. Then the other Governing Validators vote on it. If the proposal gets enough votes, then the change gets executed.

All the proposals are publicly available at https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/proposal.
