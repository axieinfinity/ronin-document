title: Validator governance
---

Ronin's governance process is conducted via a decentralized voting
mechanism.

Governing Validators can propose and vote on the following types of changes:

* Upgrade smart contracts
* Change thresholds
* Add Governing Validators
* Remove Governing Validators

A governor creates a new proposal
for other governors to vote on. If at least 70% of the
governors approve the proposal, the change is applied.

The governance voting method is serial by design: only one governance
vote can be held at a time, and that vote must be completed before moving
to a new vote. 

Conceptually, you can think of the governor as a cold wallet while the
validator is a hot wallet.

:::tip
Store your governor credentials in a hardware wallet and use them only
when a vote is required. This way, attackers have a much harder
time accessing your validator nodes, and the overall risk of network
exploitation is significantly reduced.
