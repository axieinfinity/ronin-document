# Overview
Governing Validators can make changes to the network through an on-chain governance process. 
To effect a change, a validator first submits a proposal. Then the other Governing Validators vote on it. 
If the proposal gets [enough](./vote.mdx#voting-ratio) votes, the change is implemented.

## Creating proposals
There are two ways to create proposals on Ronin:
via Validator Dashboard or by running a script.

Following are the types of proposals that can be created using
the dashboard:
* Add a new Governing Validator
* Remove a Governing Validator
* Update the chain governor address
* Update the bridge voter address

See [Create a proposal](./create.mdx) for a step-by-step guide.

## Voting on proposals
Voting takes place on Validator Dashboard.

Whether a proposal is approved or rejected is determined by the following ratio:
* A proposal is approved if at least 75% of the Governing Validators approve it.
* A proposal is rejected (and closed) if at least 25% of the Governing Validators reject it.

A proposal that is neither approved nor rejected within 14 days is automatically closed.

For instructions, see [Vote on a proposal](./vote.mdx).
