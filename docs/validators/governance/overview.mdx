# Overview
Governing Validators can make changes to the network through an on-chain governance process.

To effect a change, a Governing Validator first submits a proposal. Then the other Governing Validators vote on it. If the proposal gets enough votes, the change is implemented.

All proposals are available for public view at at https://app.roninchain.com/governance.

The interface for the Governing Validators to create and vote on proposals is https://validator.roninchain.com/proposal.
