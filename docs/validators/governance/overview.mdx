# Overview
Ronin's governance process is conducted via a decentralized voting
mechanism. Each Governing Validator has a corresponding chain governor
account. Governors are empowered to vote for proposals such as
adding or removing Governing Validators, upgrading contracts,
changing thresholds, and more.

The way it works is a a governor [creates](./create.mdx) a new proposal
for other governors to [vote](./vote.mdx) on. If 75% or more of the
governors approve the proposal, the change is applied.

The governance voting method is serial by design: only one governance
vote can be held at a time, and that vote must be completed before moving
to a new vote. 

Conceptually, you can think of the governor as a cold wallet while the
validator is a hot wallet.

:::tip
Store your governor credentials in a hardware wallet and use them only
when a vote is required. As a result, attackers will have a much harder
time accessing your validator nodes, and the overall risk of network
exploitation will be significantly reduced.
