## Overview

This page explains how to register as a validator on Ronin.
After following the steps in this guide, you'll become a
Validator Candidate and have a chance to be selected as a
Standard Validator on the next day.

## Validator roles

There are three validator roles:

* **Validator Candidate.** The role you get after following the steps
in this guide.
* **Standard Validator.** Every day, at least 10 Validator Candidates
with the highest stakes are selected as Standard Validators.
The system records your total staking amount at 00:00 UTC every day
for the selection process. 
* **Governing Validator.** The validators chosen by the community and
Sky Mavis to ensure network security. Governing Validators are
validators by default, and they account for more than half of the
total validator set.

## Before you start

Before registering as a Validator Candidate, make sure that you have at least 250,000 RON for the initial stake. To learn how to purchase RON, see [Acquire RON](./../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).
