# Types of rewards

As a validator, you can earn three types of rewards:
* **Bridge rewards.** Rewards received for verifying transactions via Ronin Bridge. 
* **Commission.** Rewards derived from the block rewards times the commission rate.
* **Staking rewards.** Rewards derived from your self-stake and divided proportionally with your delegators.
