# Free Gas Proxy

![Interactive flow from users to Ronin network](<./free-gas-proxy.png>)

This service allows Axie users to access the Ronin blockchain and send transactions without paying any RON - the Ronin native currency. The number of free transactions per day depends a userâ€™s Axie Infinity NFT holdings according to the below configurations:

Amount of free transactions from holding Axies:

* 1 Normal Axie: 3 free txs/day
* 1 MEO Axie: 10 free txs/day
* 1 Origin Axie: 100 free txs/day
* 1 Mystic Axie: 500 free txs/day

Amount free transactions from holding Lands:

* 1 Savannah Land: 20 free txs/day
* 1 Forest Land: 60 txs/day
* 1 Arctic land: 180 txs/day
* 1 Mystic Land: 350 txs/day

New Axie users will have 20 one-time transactions to start. These 20 transactions will not be reset daily and will be decreased first if the user also has daily free transactions.

The block to recalculate free gas transactions for each user is the first block confirmed from 00:00 UTC.

For example:

> On the first day, a user creates an account on the Axie marketplace and gets 20 free transactions. Next, they buy 3 Axies, leaving them with 17 remaining free transactions. 

Now, on the second day, they now have 17 free one-time transactions and 9 daily transactions - from having 3 Axies.
