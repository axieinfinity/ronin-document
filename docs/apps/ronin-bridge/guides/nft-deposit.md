## Overview

This guide describes how to deposit an NFT (non-fungible token) from your Ethereum wallet into your address on the Ronin chain. The supported NFT collections include Pixels FarmLand, Cyberkongz VX, and Cyberkongz Genkai.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit NFTs** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect your Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the NFT from. The supported wallets include Metamask and Trust Wallet.

## Step 3. Authorize the bridge to transfer your NFT

To deposit an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it, which is also referred to as *approval*. You have two ways to do it: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

### Approve a single token

You can choose to grant permission to each individual NFT that you transfer:

1. With the NFT selected, click **Approve NFT**.

2. Select **Single token**.

When you make another transfer in the future, you will need to approve it again.

### Approve all tokens

Alternatively, grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future:

1. Select the NFT you want to transfer, and then click **Approve NFT**.

2. Select **All tokens**.

This way, your future transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Deposit your NFT

1. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the deposit. Make sure you have enough ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover the fees. If everything looks correct, select **Deposit**.

2. When prompted, sign the transaction in your connected wallet.
3. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed by the network. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.

## Step 5. Receive your NFT in Ronin Wallet

When the deposit is complete, you'll see a "Deposit completed" window.

You should be able to see the deposited NFTs in your Ronin Wallet, on the **NFTs** tab.
