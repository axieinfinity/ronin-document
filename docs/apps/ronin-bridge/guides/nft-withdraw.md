## Overview

This guide describes how to withdraw an NFT (non-fungible token) from your Ronin Wallet to an address on Ethereum. The supported NFT collections include Pixels FarmLand, Cyberkongz VX, and Cyberkongz Genkai.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app on the **Deposit NFTs** tab.
2. Switch to the **Withdraw NFTs** tab by selecting the button between the **From** and **To** fields.

Double-check the recipient address to avoid sending your NFT to the wrong destination.

1. Choose the collection containing the NFTs you want to withdraw.

## Step 3. Authorize the bridge to transfer your NFT

To withdraw an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it, which is also referred to as *approval*. You have two ways to do it: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

### Approve a single token

You can choose to grant permission to each individual NFT that you transfer:

1. With the NFT selected, click **Approve NFT**.

2. Select **Single token**.

When you make another transfer in the future, you will need to approve it again.

### Approve all tokens

Alternatively, grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future:

1. Select the NFT you want to transfer, then click **Approve NFT**.

2. Select **All tokens**.

This way, your future transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Withdraw your NFT

1. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the withdrawal. Make sure you have enough ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover the fees. If everything looks correct, select **Submit withdrawal**.

2. Sign the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.
3. Select **Connect Wallet** and connect your wallet that's linked to the recipient address.
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed by the network. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.

5. When the NFT is ready to be withdrawn, select **Withdraw** to transfer it to your Ethereum address.

6. Sign the transaction in your connected Ethereum wallet to receive the transfer.

## Step 5. Receive your NFT on Ethereum

When the withdrawal is complete, you'll see a "Withdrawal completed" window.

You can check your connected wallet to verify that the NFT has arrived successfully.
