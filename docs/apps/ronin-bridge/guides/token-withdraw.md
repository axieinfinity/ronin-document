## Overview

This guide describes how to use Ronin Bridge to send an ERC20 token from your Ronin Wallet to an Ethereum wallet. For information on supported ERC20 tokens, see [Supported assets](../overview.md#supported-assets).

## Prerequisites

If you access Ronin Bridge through the Ronin Wallet mobile app, then you can only connect Ethereum wallets imported into your Ronin Wallet beforehand. For more information, see [Importing Your MetaMask Wallet to Ronin Wallet](https://support.roninchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/14862812718107-Importing-Your-MetaMask-Wallet-to-Ronin-Wallet).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app.
2. Switch to the **Withdraw** tab by selecting the button between the **From** and **To** fields.

Double-check the recipient address to avoid sending your tokens to the wrong destination.

## Step 2. Choose the token and amount

:::note[Set your spending cap]
First-time bridging ERC20 tokens requires setting a spending cap, initially set to zero. Enter your desired bridging amount, and approve the corresponding spending cap.

For future bridgings exceeding your current cap, re-approval is needed to update the limit.

Remember, the cap can't exceed your wallet's token balance.

1. Choose the ERC20 token that you want to withdraw, then enter the withdrawal amount manually or select **Max** to withdraw the entire balance of this token available in your wallet.
