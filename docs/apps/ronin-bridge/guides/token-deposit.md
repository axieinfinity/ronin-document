## Overview

This guide describes how to deposit an ERC20 token from your Ethereum wallet into your address on the Ronin chain. The supported tokens include ETH, AXS, SLP, USDC, AGG, and АЕС.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect your Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the token from. The supported wallets include Metamask and Trust Wallet.
3. In the **To** field, enter the Ronin address or RNS name that you want to deposit the token into. Note that for RNS names, you need to enter the complete name, such as "example.ron."
