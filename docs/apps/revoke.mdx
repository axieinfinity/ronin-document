## Overview

## Revoke a token approval

2. If this is your first time connecting to the AxieDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) website, then in your Ronin Wallet, grant permission by clicking **Next**, then **Connect**.

3. Review the list of token approvals associated with your connected Ronin address, sorted by dApp. Each approval has a link to the respective smart contract that handles the token.

5. After a few seconds, the approval's status changes to **Revoked** and a confirmation pop-up appears indicating that the revoke transaction is completed.

Done. You have successfully revoked the token approval for the selected dApp. If you want to use the same dApp after revoking its token approval, you'll be asked to approve once again.
