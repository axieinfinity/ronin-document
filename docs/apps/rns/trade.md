## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to trade RNS domains on the Mavis Market marketplace by listing your domain for sale to other users or by making an offer to buy a domain from someone else.

## Sell

### List for sale

You can list your RNS name on Mavis Market at a fixed price. Click **List for sale**, choose the duration of the sale, and set the price.

After you entered the necessary information, click **Confirm listing** to complete your listing.

If the owner lists a domain on Mavis Market and the listed price exceeds the current domain price, then, when another user buys the domain, the domain price changes to the listed price, also known as the *last sales price*.

Mavis Market charges a 2.5% service fee for a successful sale. For example, if someone buys your domain for 100 RON, you receive 97.5 WRON.

### Edit your listing

To make a change to your listing, you need to cancel the existing listing and submit a new listing with the updated details.

### Accept an offer

When someone makes a few offers on your listing, you can view all of them at once. To accept an offer, click **Accept offer** on the offer you wish to accept. Payment is only accepted in WRON, not RON.

## Buy

### Make an offer

Every newly registered (minted) RNS domain is searchable on Mavis Market.

If you want to purchase an RNS domain registered by someone else, you can make an offer to the owner. Enter the amount of WETH or WRON you wish to offer, select the duration of the offer, and click **Make offer**.
