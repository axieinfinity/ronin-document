## 1. What are different categories of RNS domains? {#1}

There are regular, auctioned, and protected RNS domains. For more information, see [Domain name categories](./../overview.md#domain-name-categories).

## 2. How are RNS domains priced? {#2}

The price of an RNS domain name depends on its annual renewal fee, the domain's market price, and a reservation fee. For more information, see [Domain price](./../overview.md#domain-price).

## 3. Why do RNS domains have different colors? {#3}

Those colors refer to the domain tier, which indicates a domain's value. For more information, see [Domain tiers](./../overview.md#domain-tiers).

## 4. What happens if I don't renew my RNS domain? {#4}

You can renew your domain's registration at any time during the existing registration and within 90 days after it expires, also known as the *grace period*. During the grace period, the domain name is reserved only for its previous owner to renew it, and it can't be set as primary.

After the grace period, the domain name becomes available for anyone to register. The domain may still appear in your domain list, but you are no longer the owner. However, you can buy the domain back at any time.

## 5. Can I register an RNS subdomain? {#5}

For the time being, you can only register second-level domains of the form `hello.ron`. Subdomains such as `say.hello.ron` are not supported.
