## Overview

This guide shows how to register a new `.ron` domain name for your Ronin address.

In Ronin Name Service (RNS), regular names are available on a first-come, first-served basis with an annual renewal fee that depends on the domain name's length. Regular names are listed as **Available**.

### Renewal fee

Following is the annual renewal fee for regular RNS names.

| Name length | Renewal fee |
|---|---|
| 5+ characters | $5/year |
| 4 characters | $100/year |
| 3 characters | $300/year |

### Naming guidelines

Following are the guidelines to be observed when choosing an RNS name:

* Domains can contain the English-language letters a-z, and the digits 0-9.
* Hyphens can also be used but not at the beginning and at the end of a domain name. Two hyphens together aren't permitted either.
* The minimum length is three characters.
* Domain names are case-sensitive and can only contain lowercase letters.

## Before you start

Before registering a regular domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

## Register a regular domain

1. At the request transaction, select the duration of your registration period in years (1).
   :::tip
   We recommend registering your RNS name for multiple years to avoid losing the domain to someone else.
   :::
   The renewal fee changes based on how many years you want to register the domain for. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. **Note:** This name is *set as primary* by default (2), which means that it's displayed as your RNS name in all the RNS-enabled apps and wallets.
