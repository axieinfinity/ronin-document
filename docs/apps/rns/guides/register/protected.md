## Overview

This guide shows how to register a protected `.ron` domain name.

Protected names, which are reserved by Sky Mavis for its official partners and key community members, are not available to anyone else. In RNS, these names are listed as **Protected**.

Sky Mavis provides direct support to prevent anyone from squatting or misusing your protected name. Renewal fees for protected RNS names are fixed and not affected by the market.

:::caution
As long as the owner doesn't sell or transfer their RNS name to another wallet, the name and its annual fee are protected. If the name is sold or transferred, it's no longer considered *protected*, but its renewal fee remains unchanged.

## Before you start

Before registering a protected domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

1. Select the duration of your registration period in years (1). The renewal fee changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. Notice that the name is set as primary by default (2), which means that it's displayed as your RNS name in all the RNS-enabled apps.
