## Overview

This guide shows how to register a protected `.ron` domain name.

Protected names are reserved for brands and businesses by Sky Mavis and cannot be purchased by anyone else. Sky Mavis provides direct support to prevent anyone from claiming or misusing your protected RNS name. Protected names are listed as **Protected** in the RNS app.

:::caution
As long as the owner doesn't sell or transfer their protected RNS name to another wallet, the name and its annual fee are protected. If the name is sold or transferred, it loses its *protected* status.

### Renewal fee

The annual renewal fees for protected RNS names are predetermined and are not affected by market fluctuations.

## Before you start

Before registering a protected domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

1. Select the duration of your registration period in years (1). The renewal fee changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. Notice that the name is set as primary by default (2), which means that it's displayed as your RNS name in all RNS-enabled apps and wallets.
