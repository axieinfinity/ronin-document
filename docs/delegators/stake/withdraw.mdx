# Withdraw stake
You can withdraw a part of, or all of your stake from a validator,
as long as it's been three days since your last staking operation on Ronin.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator from which you want to withdraw the stake,
expand the options, and then select **Withdraw stake**.
