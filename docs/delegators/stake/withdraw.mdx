# Withdraw stake
You can withdraw your stake at any time and without penalties as
long as three days have passed since you last staked in
to this validator.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator from which you want to withdraw the stake,
expand the options, and then select **Withdraw stake**.

  If you're still in the three-day waiting period,
the system shows how long you need to wait until
withdrawal is possible.

To withdraw your entire stake, select **Max**
followed by **Withdraw and undelegate**.
