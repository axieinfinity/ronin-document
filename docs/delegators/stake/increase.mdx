# Stake more
After becoming a delegator, you can increase your stake by delegating
more RON to your validators.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator where you want to stake more,
expand the options, and then select **Delegate**.

3. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all your
available RON, and then select **Delegate**. The estimated rewards are
calculated based on your APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.
