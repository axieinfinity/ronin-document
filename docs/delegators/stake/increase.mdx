# Stake more
After becoming a delegator, you can increase your stake by delegating
more RON to your validators.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator to increase the stake, expand the options,
and then select **Delegate**.

2. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all available RON,
and then select **Stake**. The estimated reward is
calculated based on your estimated APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.
