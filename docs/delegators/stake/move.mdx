# Move stake
You can move your stake to a different validator at any time and
without penalties as long as three days have passed since you last
staked in to this validator.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator from which you want to move the stake,
expand the options, and then select **Move stake**.

  If you're still in the three-day waiting period,
the system shows how long you need to wait until
moving the stake is possible.

3. Enter the amount manually and select **Move stake**.
To move your entire stake, select **Max**
followed by **Move stake and undelegate**.
