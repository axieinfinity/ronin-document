# Move stake
You can move your stake between different validators.
For example, if a validator is renouncing or if you found
another validator with higher returns.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator from which you want to move the stake,
expand the options, and then select **Move stake**.

3. Enter the amount manually and select **Move stake**.
To move your entire stake, select **Max**
followed by **Move stake and undelegate**.

4. Confirm the transaction.
