## Introduction

This page demonstrates how to increase, move, or withdraw your existing stake.

## Before you start

Before managing your stake, you need to [become a delegator](./../onboarding/become-delegator.mdx).

## Stake more

After becoming a delegator, you can increase your stake by delegating
more RON to your validators.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

1. Pick the validator where you want to stake more,
expand the options, and then select **Delegate**.

1. Enter the amount manually or choose **Max** to stake all your
available RON, and then select **Delegate**. The estimated rewards are
calculated based on your APR (annual percentage rate),
so you can see how much RON will return from this stake.

## Move stake

You can move your stake to a different validator at any time and
without penalties as long as three days have passed since you last
staked in to this validator.

1. Go to [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) >
**My staking**.

2. Pick the validator from which you want to move the stake,
expand the options, and then select **Move stake**.

  If you're still in the three-day waiting period,
the system shows how long you need to wait until
moving the stake is possible.

To move your entire stake, select **Max**
followed by **Move stake and undelegate**.
