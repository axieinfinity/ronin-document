## 1. What if my delegated validator is slashed? {#1}

While your validator is punished through [slashing](./../validators/slashing.mdx), you don't receive staking rewards, but your stake is not affected in any way.

## 2. Will my staking rewards automatically re-stake to my validator? {#2}

You can manually [restake](./manage/claim-rewards.mdx#restake-your-rewards) the rewards to your favorite validator.

## 3. Can I withdraw my stake whenever I want without any penalties? {#3}

You can [withdraw your stake](./manage/stake.mdx#withdraw-stake) from one of your validators at any time without penalties, as long as it's been three or more days since you last staked with this validator.

## 4. If I stake RON with a validator today, when will I receive the rewards? {#4}

The pool of validators for each day is finalized a few minutes past 00:00 UTC. If you stake your RON tokens today, then your stake will take effect around 00:00 UTC the next day. From then on, you'll start earning staking rewards.

## 5. If I move my RON stake from one validator to another, when will I start earning rewards again? {#5}

Your RON stake with new validator will start producing rewards from around 00:00 UTC the next day. As for the validator that you moved your stake from, there will be no rewards for the current day because the stake is removed.

## 6. How do I know if my validator is renouncing? {#6}

You will receive a notification seven days before the validator's renunciation date. For more ways to keep track of your validators, see [Track validators](./manage/validators.mdx).

## 7. How can I know if a validator is well-performing? {#7}

When choosing a validator to stake with, consider the following factors to maximize your RON rewards:

* A higher uptime means the validator is more reliable by keeping their node consistently running.
* A higher annual performance rate (APR) means greater staking rewards.
* If you're staking to a validator candidate, then a larger total stake means a higher chance that this validator will be one of the 10 validators chosen for block confirmation the next day.
* Governing Validators (marked with a green checkmark) are guaranteed to always be chosen as validators.

You can always learn more about a validator by clicking their name in the list of validators on the [RON Staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) page.
