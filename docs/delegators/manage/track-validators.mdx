There are a few ways you can keep track of changes among your
validators on [RON Staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking):

* Before staking to a validator, learn about the validator's total stake
by visiting **Analytics > Total Stake** in their profile.

* You can also check the amount of delegators' rewards (both claimed and
not claimed) for the last 30 days by selecting **Analytics > Rewards**.

* If a validator has scheduled to change their commission rate,
the clock icon appears on their profile. Hover over the icon for details.

* If a validator is punished or jailed, you can see which rewards
they will not receive according to the slashing tier theyâ€™re in.

* If a validator requested renunciation, you can see when it takes effect.
