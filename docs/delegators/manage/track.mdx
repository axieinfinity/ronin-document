# Track validators
There are a few ways you can keep track of changes among your
validators on [RON Staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking):

* Before staking to a validator, visit the validator's profile to 
see their rewards, block analysis, and the list of their delegators.

* If a validator has scheduled to change their commission rate,
the clock icon appears on their profile. Hover over the icon for details.

* If a validator is punished or jailed, you can see which rewards
they will not receive according to the slashing tier theyâ€™re in.

* If a validator requested renunciation, you can see when it takes effect.
