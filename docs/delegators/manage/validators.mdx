There are a few ways you can keep track of changes among your
validators on the [RON Staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) page:

* Before staking to a validator, learn about the validator's total stake
by visiting **Analytics > Total Stake** in their profile.

* You can also check the amount of delegators' rewards (both claimed and
not claimed) for the last 30 days by selecting **Analytics > Rewards**.
    <img src={rewardStats} width={1440} />

* If a validator is punished or jailed, you can see which rewards
they will not receive according to the slashing tier theyâ€™re in.

* If a validator requested renunciation, you can see when it takes effect.
