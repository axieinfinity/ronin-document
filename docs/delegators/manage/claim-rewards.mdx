## Overview

This page describes how to claim your RON staking rewards or restake them to your favorite validator.

:::info How staking rewards are calculated
Your rewards are calculated based on your lowest balance per day.
This means that if it's your first day to delegate, you will not
receive any rewards for that period because your lowest balance for that day is zero.
You will only get rewards if the validators you chose to delegate to get selected for block confirmation for that day.
It's also possible that you get less or no rewards if your chosen validator is punished due to being unavailable or due to malicious activities.

## Claim your rewards

1. Go to the [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) page and select
the **My staking** tab.
2. In the **CLAIMABLE REWARDS** section, select **Claim all**. This amount is
the reward emitted from your total stake to your validators prior to 00:00 UTC
today.

You can claim staking rewards once per day. After claiming, the next claim will be available at around 00:00 UTC 
the next day.

## Restake your rewards

Instead of claiming the RON staking rewards to your Ronin Wallet, you can restake them to your favorite validator, which will increase your staking power.

1. In the **CLAIMABLE REWARDS** secttion, click **Restake**.
