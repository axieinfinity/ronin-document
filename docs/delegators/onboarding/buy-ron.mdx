# Buy RON
RON is the native token of Ronin, and can be used to pay for gas 
fees and participate in staking. Like other cryptocurrencies, 
there are multiple ways to acquire RON on Ronin.

## Buy on a centralized exchange
Centralized exchanges are businesses that allow you to buy RON
with traditional currency. After purchasing RON from a centralized
exchange, you can then send it back to your Ronin Wallet to enjoy
Ronin dApps. Centralized exchanges can be restricted in certain
geographical locations.

Applicable fees differ between exchanges.

Here's a list of exchanges that support RON:
* [OKX](https://www.okx.com/)
* [Gate.io](https://gate.io/)
* [CoinEx](https://www.coinex.com/)
* [MEXC Global](https://www.mexc.com/)
* [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/)
* [Coins.ph](https://coins.ph/)

methods via the Purchase site. The Purchase site is powered by

to your transaction. The fee varies based on the payment method you choose.

The Purchase site can be accessed directly through the Ronin Wallet mobile app.
To do so, visit the **dApps** tab in your Ronin Wallet,
and then select **Purchase**. Alternatively, you can access
the site at [purchase.roninchain.com](https://purchase.roninchain.com/).
