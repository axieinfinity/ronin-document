## Overview

Stake your RON with your favorite validator to help secure the network while simultaneously earning some great rewards. 

This guide shows how to stake your RON tokens to your favorite validators to help secure the network and earn staking rewards. Staking is also referred to as "delegation," named after the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism used by the Ronin network.

## Prerequisites

Acquire RON tokens by following the steps in the [Acquire RON](./../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx) guide.

## Stake your RON

1. Go to the [RON staking](https://app.roninchain.com/staking) page and click the
**Connect wallet** button in the top right corner.

2. On the **All validators** tab, choose a validator to stake your RON with, and then select **Delegate**.

   Can't decide which validator to stake with? Here are some things to consider:
   * A higher uptime means the validator is more reliable by keeping their node consistently running.
   * A higher interest rate means greater staking rewards.
   * If you're staking to a validator candidate, then a larger total stake means a higher chance that this validator will be selected to confirm blocks the next day.
   
   You can also learn more about a validator by clicking their name.

3. Enter the amount of RON to stake, then click **Delegate**.
