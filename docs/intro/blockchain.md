#### What is a Blockchain?

Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets, and building trust.

#### What is a Sidechain? <a href="#what-is-a-sidechain" id="what-is-a-sidechain"></a>

Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting the transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternative to the parent chain ; it has its own blockspace and mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains. This is often done through a bridge.
