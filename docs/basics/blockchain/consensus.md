# What is consensus?
## Types of consensus
### Proof-of-Authority
Proof-of-authority is a consensus algorithm that delivers an efficient solution for blockchains, specifically private ones. The term was coined in 2017 by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. 
In proof-of-authority, machines earn the right to generate new blocks by passing a strict vetting process, which is discussed in detail in the next section. As a  result, trustworthy validation machines protect PoA blockchains. These system moderators are preapproved participants who check blocks and transactions.

### Delegated-Proof-of-Stake

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm that is a variation of the classic Proof of Stake (PoS) system. DPoS evolved from PoS and allows users of the network to vote in delegates who then validate blocks.

### Proof-of-Staked-Authority

Proof-of-Staked-Authority is a combination between Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and PoA. Token holders use their stake to vote and elect the validator set. Then, Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner.
