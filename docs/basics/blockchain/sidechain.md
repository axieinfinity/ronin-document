# What is a sidechain?

Think of a sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting the transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternative to the parent chain ; it has its own blockspace and mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains. This is often done through a bridge.
