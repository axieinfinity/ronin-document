# Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where nodes collectively execute a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
