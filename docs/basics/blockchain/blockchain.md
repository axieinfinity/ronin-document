# What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where nodes collectively execute a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
