# Delegator

Delegator is a RON token holder who might not have a RON supply large enough to reach the minimum staking amount required to become a Validator Candidate. Instead, the delegator contributes (delegates) some amount of their RON tokens (their stake) to a preferred validator.

Anyone can be a delegator—individuals and institutions.

## Staking

### Staking through a validator

RON stakers can choose a validator. Validators can set a fee that they take from their delegates. Validators receive gas fees, dApp revenues, and staking issuance and share them with stakers pro-rata—a validator fee (commission) set by each validator.

So a staker's weekly reward will be:
 ((Staking issuance reward + gas fees + dapp fees)- commission).

A staking dashboard is created for non-validators to easily select a validator to stake with and claim their rewards.

### Staking principles

* Staking incentivizes RON holders to lock up their tokens and gives them more ownership of the network for this conviction.
* Validators are incentivized to help grow the network, which increases the value of the fees collected from their delegates.
