# Multisig wallet
A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet is a wallet that requires multiple keys to sign a transaction before it can be executed. For example, you can set up multiple devices, such as hardware wallets, EOA-based wallets, paper wallets, or a combination of them, to confirm transactions.

On Ronin, we built our multi-sig wallet around Gnosis Safe: https://gnosis-safe.roninchain.com/
