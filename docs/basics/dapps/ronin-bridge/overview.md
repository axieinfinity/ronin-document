# Ronin Bridge
A bridge refers to a mechanism that allows different blockchain networks to communicate and transfer data or value between them. Ronin Bridge allows clients to transfer tokens between Ethereum and Ronin chains. 

[Ronin Bridge](https://bridge.roninchain.com) is a multi-signature (multisig) bridge. It requires multiple approvals from a group of bridge operators before a transaction can be executed. Multisig bridges are designed to improve the security and trustworthiness of cross-chain transactions, as they require a consensus among several parties before a transaction can be confirmed. This makes it more difficult for any single party to act maliciously or make unauthorized changes to the transaction.
