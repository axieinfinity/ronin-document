# Katana Swap

Katana is an AMM decentralized exchange built on top of Ronin.

## Key features

* **Swap:** Users can swap (trade) between pairs of ERC 20 tokens.
* **Pool:** Users can deposit liquidity for ERC 20 tokens and earn market making fees as well as additional RON rewards. For now, pool-creation is white-listed. Over time, there may be a more open procedure for creating new pairs on Ronin.

## Rewards
As a special roll-out feature, 10% (100,000,000) of the RON supply will be distributed to liquidity providers in 2 key pools over the first 90 days. Future rewards will be decided  based on data accumulated through the launch. Note that AXS and SLP make up 2 of the launch pools. This is intended to give a stake in Ronin to its most fervent users so far, the Axie community.

## Pool and fees

**Why is the RON/ETH pool not launching immediately?**

It's important that Ronin has shared ownership by the community that builds and uses it. If a RON/ETH pool was launched immediately, it would be vulnerable to price volatility due to lack of sell pressure. This would cause lots of volatility that could harm our community. Typically token launches have pre-sales to private investors. These sales provide some initial sell pressure and act to make sure that the price is harder to manipulate. We did not want to do a private sale for the RON token so this mechanism for price stability was not on the table.
By delaying the launch of the RON/ETH pool, we can make sure that when the pool launches, there's a diverse group of stakeholders that own the token and can act to stabilize the price in case of large swings.
