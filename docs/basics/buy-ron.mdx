## Overview

RON is the native token of Ronin, and can be used to pay for gas 
fees and participate in staking. Like other cryptocurrencies, 
there are multiple ways to acquire RON on Ronin.

## Buy through a CEX

A centralized exchange (CEX) is a business that allows you to buy RON
with traditional currency. After purchasing RON from a CEX, you can then send it back to your Ronin Wallet to enjoy
Ronin dApps. Centralized exchanges can be restricted in certain
geographical locations, and applicable fees differ among exchanges.
