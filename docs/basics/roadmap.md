# Roadmap

This page is barebones. Should be a timeline deriver from the content of Aleksander's slides.

**Moving toward decentralization**

As previously explored in the “Consensus” section, the Ronin Blockchain uses Proof of Authority (POA) consensus. 
Currently, Ronin uses Proof-of-Authority (PoA) as the consensus protocol. In PoA systems, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. Although this mechanism is highly secure, it’s neither scalable nor decentralized since new validators need to be approved by the majority of current validators.

To increase the decentralization of Ronin, we follow a similar strategy as BNB smart chain (BSC) and use Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) instead of PoA—see more details in our [white paper](white-paper.md). On 11/15/2022, we launched our DPoS protocol on Saigon Testnet. We are aiming to launch the DPoS protocol on the Mainnet in the end of Q1 2023.

To accommodate for this, our current plan is to move to a more decentralized consensus (like dPOS) in 2022. Some layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains are being researched by our core team with the long term goal of enhancing Ronin’s future performance and scalability.

**Increasing Scalability**

Blockchain scalability is arguably the holy grail and bottleneck of the cryptocurrency world and mainly refers to transaction speed. At the moment, the Ronin Network can only support up to 200 transactions per seconds. 
We are researching on Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), a layer-2  scaling solution, to enhance Ronin’s future performance and scalability.
