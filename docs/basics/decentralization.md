# Decentralization

Decentralization is a key theme that will empower grassroots digital communities to take control of their data, identity, and digital property over the coming years. It's very important that Ronin progressively decentralize over time. With hundreds of thousands of holders on Day 1 and a diverse group of contributors to the Axie community, Ronin is already quite decentralized from an ownership perspective and contribution perspective. There are many aspects of decentralization- breadth of contribution, ownership, and of course consensus mechanism/data storage. It can be hard to optimize for all of these factors initially and we must keep in mind that a huge risk to decentralization is failing and having a small community. This means that taking a pragmatic approach to adoption is also needed.
These are the key actions that will be taken to decentralize Ronin even further:

## Adding validators
Adding a geographically and ideologically diverse stream of validators to Ronin will be a key initiative that unfolds over the coming weeks, months, and years. In 2022, we will open up a validator application process. Axie Infinity players come from every country except North Korea. This portends huge diversity for the Ronin validator community.

## Adding new developers
Ronin has been built for the next generation of builders and dreamers to launch fun, beautiful, and rewarding NFT experiences. RON has been reserved for an ecosystem fund that will help incentivize and support a diverse group of builders. It's expected that new builders will be on-boarded to Ronin starting in 2022 and accelerating in the years to come.

We expect applications to be built on top of Ronin to include:
* A wide range of games that are powered by player-owned economies.
* Financial applications that democratize basic financial services.
* Social coordination tools that ensure digital communities can build together efficiently and systematically. 

## Phases
Here are some phases that will further strengthen the network. Please note that there are many things that could change the ordering of these priorities including massive traction, breakthrough research, and feedback from the community.

### Phase 1
* At least 10 validators outside of Sky Mavis.
* At least 3 external teams building NFT games/experiences on top of Ronin.

### Phase 2
* Ronin is upgraded to delegated proof of stake with RON staking through validators.
* Validators vote on contract deployment proposals on Ronin.
* At least 5 teams building NFT games/experiences on top of Ronin.
* At least 20 validators outside of Sky Mavis.

### Phase 3
* Upgrade Ronin's consensus based on breakthroughs in scalability and
* security research.
* 100+ Validators.
* Fees from protocols and NFT sales outside of Axie universe sent to validators and shared with delegators.
