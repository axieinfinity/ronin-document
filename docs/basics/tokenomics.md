# Tokenomics

## Quick facts
* **Supply.** The RON token is a capped utility token. The circulating supply at launch is approximately 185 million tokens, and the total cap is fixed at 1 billion tokens.
* **Token utility.** The RON token enables users to pay for transactions on Ronin, includes decentralized finance (DeFi) features like community governance, and utility via staking through validators to earn rewards.
* **Staking rewards.** 250 million tokens, or 25% of the total supply, are distributed as staking rewards to validators and delegators for securing the network over time.

## Token distribution
The quantity of RON reserved for various network functions, as a percentage of the total existing token supply, follows this distribution:
* Staking rewards: 25%
* Community incentives: 30%
* Sky Mavis: 30%
* Ecosystem fund: 15%

After 5 years, gas and protocol fees will totally replace staking rewards.

## Token release schedule
The maximum supply of RON will be released after 294 months since the start of issuance. Some delays in issuance related to staking and community rewards should be expected.
