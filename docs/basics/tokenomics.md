# Tokenomics

## Ronin token - RON
RON is the ecosystem token of the Ronin blockchain. Its main purpose is to secure and decentralize the network. Ronin will thrive if RON is in the hands of the builders and users of the network.
Ronin validators will need to hold and stake RON to participate in validating blocks. They are rewarded with newly issued RON. This RON is divided up among a validator and its delegates pro-rata based on the RON they have staked with the validator. The validator may also elect to take a fee from its delegates. Please note that this structure is not finalized and may be altered as new research and trends come to light.

Holders of RON will be able to stake their RON tokens with a validator to earn RON rewards and participate in governance of the network. Fee structure and use of the RON treasury are potential governance topics.
