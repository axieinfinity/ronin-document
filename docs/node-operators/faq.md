# Node operator FAQ

Here's a list of most common questions.

### 1. How do I know my candidate node is working properly?

### 2. How do I know my bridge operator node is working properly?

### 3. How do I generate needed private keys? Generating all keys from a single seed seems very unsecure.

### 4. Should chain governor address be different from admin address?

### 5. How to use multisig for admin address tasks (change commission, renounce, claim rewards)?

### 6. How to use multisig for chain governor address tasks (create a proposal, vote for a proposal)?

### 7. Any node health monitoring recommendation?

### 8. Recommended security? What ports (if any) have to be open to outside world?

### 9. If there is a node/bridge update, how do I get this information? How much time I will have to update my nodes? What happens if I don't update in time?
