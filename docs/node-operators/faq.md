# Node operator FAQ
Here's a list of frequently asked questions.

### 1. How do I know if my validator node is working properly?
After starting the validator node, run the following command:

```
docker-compose logs node | head -n 20
```

Verify that the account address in the response matches your registered consensus address.

```
node       | Using account acf8bf98d1632e602d0b1761771049af21dd6597
```

Also check the node's availability on https://stats.roninchain.com/.

### 2. How do I know if my bridge operator node is working properly?
After starting the bridge, run the following command:

```
docker-compose logs bridge | head -n 20
```

Verify that the operator account address in the response matches your registered bridge operator address. If you're a Governing Validator, also check that the voter account address matches the registered bridge voter address.

```
bridge     | INFO [03-22|07:59:10.368] [RoninListener] Operator account         address=0x2e82D2b56f858f79DeeF11B160bFC4631873da2B
bridge     | INFO [03-22|07:59:10.368] [RoninListener] Voter account            address=0x2295EdAA6BD5c07fB3227628c62Af12248106667
```

Also check the node's availability on https://stats.roninchain.com/.

### 3. How do I generate the required private keys?
See [Generate keys](./generate-keys.md).

### 4. Should the chain governor address be different from the admin address?
We recommend using different governor and admin addresses to reduce the impact of leaks or losses to either account.

### 5. How to use multisig wallet as a validator?
Using a multi-signature wallet can provide an additional layer of security when running your validator node. 

Ronin's Validator Portal is supported in [Ronin Multisig](https://multisig.roninchain.com)â€”you can find it under the Multisig's **Apps** tab. After creating a safe, use your safe's address as an admin or governor address. Each action with this safe's address will require multiple confirmations depending on your safe settings.

### 6. Any node health monitoring recommendation?
* Integrate with https://stats.roninchain.com/ for the overall status of the chain's node. If you followed the node setup guides, your node is already there. 
* For each node, the system publishes metrics on port `6060` for Prometheus collection. Integrate a Prometheus-Grafana stack for more granular monitoring of your node's health.

### 7. What ports (if any) have to be open to the outside world?
Keep public ports only for peering and discovery, otherwise keep it internal. Our `docker-compose` configuration already binds RPC port `8545` to `localhost`.

For more information, see [Security hardening](./secure.md).

### 8. If there is a node or bridge upgrade, how do I get this information? 
Latest version of Ronin and its changelog are always available at [Ronin release](https://github.com/axieinfinity/ronin/releases). Stay up-to-date with Ronin upgrades by joining our Discord community. 

### 9. How much time do I have to upgrade my nodes? What if I don't do it in time?
Upgrades are usually backwards-compatible. It can contain performance improvements, bug fixes or new features. It's recommended that every node is upgraded as soon as possible.

An upgrade, however, can also be a hardfork, which is usually not backwards-compatible. If your node fails to upgrade before a hardfork block occurs, the data on your node can differ from that on the network. Therefore, it's critical to upgrade your node before a hardfork occurs. All Ronin-planned hardforks are announced seven days in advance on our Discord and [Ronin Substack](https://roninblockchain.substack.com/).
