# Withdraw stake

You can withdraw part of, or all RON from a validator without penalties. The only requirement for withdrawal is it has to be at least three days since the last time you staked in.

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/) and select **My Staking**.
2. Click **Action > Withdraw stake**.
