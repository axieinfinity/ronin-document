# Delegator FAQ

## 1. If my delegated validator no longer performs as expected or gets compromised in some way, will I lose my stake?
Only the validator gets slashed, while delegators can find a new validator to re-stake their RON.

## 2. Do RON rewards automatically re-stake to my delegated validator?
No, these are the rewards that you need to manually [claim](./claim-rewards.md) to your Ronin Wallet.

## 3. Can I unstake whenever I want without penalties and risk of losing my stake?
Yes, you can unstake at any time without penalties. The only constraint is that it has to be at least three days since you last staked in.

## 4. If I delegate to a validator today, would I receive the reward by the end of day?
Today's validator list have been finalized since 00:00 UTC, your stake today would take effect at 00:00 UTC the next day and this is the time you start earning rewards.

## 5 Do have to wait for 2 days for the new rewards if I withdraw RON from one another then delegate to another validator?
In this case, you should move your stake from one validator to another so that your rewards are re-calculated from 00:00 UTC the next day. It takes ~2 days if you decide to withdraw then re-stake separately.

## 6. Am I informed of the renunciation of my validators?
Yes, you will receive a notification seven days in advance.

## 7. How can I know if a validator is well-performing?
Look at things like uptime (their node is almost active), APR (appealing interest rate), total staking (higher balance helps increase the chance they're selected in the next days...).
