# Delegator FAQ

## If my delegated validator fails to fulfill their duty or gets compromised, will I lose my stake?
No, there is no risk of losing RON for you as a delegator. You can see always see each validator's status on the staking dashboard, and you have the option to withdraw your RON at any time.

## Do RON rewards automatically re-stake to my delegated validator?
No, these are the rewards that you need to manually [claim](claim-rewards) to your Ronin Wallet.

## Can I unstake whenever I want without penalties and risk of losing my stake?
Yes, you can withdraw part of, or all RON from a validator without penalties. The only requirement for withdrawal is it has to be at least three days since the last time you staked in.
