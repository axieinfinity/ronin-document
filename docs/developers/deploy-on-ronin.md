# Allowlisted applications

In the past years we've seen several blockchain networks struggle with applications that deploy poorly optimized smart contracts. Some applications might not be hostile in nature but their existance is oftentimes a threat to the stability of the network. 

To ensure the stability of Ronin Network the validators and Sky Mavis will work together to allowlist critical infrastructure and value-add applications. The governance group (Sky Mavis and Ronin validators) will take action towards actors that find ways to deploy smart contracts outside the allowlist. 

Ronin Network will eventually evolve into an open network where anyone can deploy smart contracts, but it will take time. We believe that fully decentralized applications will win in the long run. There are battles however, that need to be won today with the solutions that work right now.
