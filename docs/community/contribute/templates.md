# Templates for Ronin documentation

You can copy any of these templates into a new Markdown file as the first step
in creating a new page and opening a pull request (PR):

* [Concept](#concept)
* [Task](#task)
* [Reference](#reference)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
* [Get started](#get-started)
* [Tutorial](#tutorial)

## Headers

In the templates, H1 header is always reserved for the title of the page:

```
# Title

## A section header

Some text

### A sub-section header

Some other text
```

For sections headers, use H2 and lower levels, and don't skip levels (for
example, don't use H2 then H4).

If you're using a template not for creating a whole new page, but to add a new
topic to an existing page, then remove the H1 title header from the template,
and adjust the other header styles accordingly so that they match the existing
headers on the page.

## Title metadata

All the templates contain the `title` metadata attribute. By default, Docusaurus
generates a page title from the H1 header at the top of the page. But sometimes
the title can get so long it gets truncated in the sidebar. To prevent that, you
can give the page a shorter, mode sidebar-friendly title by using the `title`
metadata. Another reason is the page title might not be consistent with other
pages in a section. You can again edit the title metadata to achieve
consistency.

Example when no `title` is used:

```
# Security hardening for your validator node
```

Example with a shorter title defined in the `title` metadata:

```
---
title: Security hardening
---

# Security hardening for your validator node
```
