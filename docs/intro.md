# Introduction

Ronin is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant proof of authority (POA) network operated by validators. Carefully selected, trusted validators are predefined at the bootstrap of the network. Later, new validators can be added or old validators can be removed if the decision is approved by the majority of currently active validators.&#x20;

In the future, Ronin consensus will be migrated to dPOS to enable complete decentralization as well as nodes' freedom to join the network as validators/miners. dPoS is a more democratic way of choosing who verifies the next block, allowing a more diverse group of people to participate in the process since it’s based on earned reputation as a lawful staker and not overall wealth. Additionally, because there are a limited number of validators, DPoS allows the network to reach consensus more quickly.

Ronin is an Ethereum sidechain. It supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols so that developers are able to build high-performance, feature-rich blockchain projects. Ronin is specifically customized for Axie Infinity, which makes it a natural fit for gaming, collectibles, and art.

Ronin is built by Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity.  In order for Axie to go truly viral and reach the friends and family of our friends and family, Axie needs a long term scaling solution that broadens access to our revolution.

That’s why we’ve built Ronin — an Ethereum sidechain made specifically for Axie Infinity. A Ronin was a samurai without a master in feudal Japan; Ronin represents our desire to take the destiny of our product into our own hands.

#### What is a Blockchain?

Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets, and building trust.&#x20;

#### What is a Sidechain? <a href="#what-is-a-sidechain" id="what-is-a-sidechain"></a>

Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting the transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternative to the parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.
