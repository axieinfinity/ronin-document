## Set primary RNS name

Your Ronin address can serve as the record address for one or multiple RNS domains. You can use one of these domains as your *primary* name on the Ronin network. A primary name is the one that appears as your identity across all Ronin ecosystem dApps supporting RNS, including the Ronin Wallet. You can have only one primary name at a time, but you can change it as needed.

### First time

## Extend your registration

You can extend your domain registration anytime during the registration period and within 90 days after it expires, which is the 90-day grace period. During the grace period, the domain name is reserved only for its previous registrant to expand its registration. After the grace period, the name is no longer reserved and becomes open to the public to register.
