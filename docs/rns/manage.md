## Overview

After you registered your RNS name, managing it is easy. Click your connected wallet in the top right corner to open your account, and select **My domains** to access and edit all your registered domain names.

On the **My domains** tab, you can sort your registered domains by status, domain length, expiration date, and more. Select a domain to access the domain management page. From there, you can set the domain as primary and extend your domain registration.

## Set primary RNS name

Your Ronin address can serve as the record address for one or multiple RNS domains. You can use one of these domains as your *primary* name on the Ronin network. A primary name is the one that appears as your identity across all Ronin ecosystem dApps supporting RNS, including the Ronin Wallet. You can have only one primary name at a time, but you can change it as needed.

To set a primary name for the first time, take these steps:

1. Go to your account and click **Select primary name** at the top.
2. Select the domain you want to set as primary, and click **Confirm**.
3. Sign the transaction.

You can also set a domain name as primary during [registration](./guides/register/regular.md).

To set a primary name the next time, take these steps:

1. On the **My domains** tab, select the domain name that you want to set as primary.
2. Click **Manage** to open the domain management page.
3. Click **Set as primary**, then **Confirm**.
4. Sign the transaction.

To remove a primary name, go to your account and click **Remove**.

## Extend your registration

You can extend your domain registration anytime during the registration period and within 90 days after it expires, which is the 90-day grace period. During the grace period, the domain name is reserved only for its previous registrant to expand its registration. After the grace period, the name is no longer reserved and becomes open to the public to register.

:::tip
To quickly extend your primary name's registration, go to your account and click **Extend**.

   * Renewal fee times the requested number of years.
   * 15% tax on the current domain price. **Note:** If the domain you're extending is about to expire and there is a valid offer to buy the domain from another user, then 15% tax is derived from the new price.
