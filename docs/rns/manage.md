## Overview

After you registered your RNS name, managing it is easy. Click your connected wallet in the top right corner to open your account, and select **My domains** to access and edit all your registered domain names.

On the **My domains** tab, you can sort your registered domains by status, domain length, expiration date, and more. Select a domain to access the domain management page. From there, you can set the domain as primary and extend your domain registration.

The **My biddings** tab is where you can view all your current and past bids for auctioned domains, as well as the status of each bid.

And **Favorites** is for the domains you added to wishlist.

## Set primary RNS name

Your Ronin address can serve as the record address for one or multiple RNS domains. You can use one of these domains as your primary name on the Ronin network. A primary name is the one that appears as your identity across all Ronin ecosystem dApps supporting RNS, including the Ronin Wallet. You can have only one primary name at a time, but you can change it as needed.

To set a primary name for the first time, take these steps:

1. Go to your account and click **Select primary name** at the top.
2. Select the domain you want to set as primary, and click **Confirm**.
3. Sign the transaction.

To set a primary name the next time, take these steps:

1. On the **My domains** tab, select the domain name that you want to set as primary.
2. Click **Manage** to open the domain management page.
3. Click **Set as primary**, then **Confirm**.
4. Sign the transaction.

To remove a primary name, go to your account and click **Remove**.

## Extend your registration

You can extend your domain registration anytime during the registration period and within 90 days after it expires, which is the 90-day grace period. During the grace period, the domain name is reserved only for its previous registrant to expand its registration. After the grace period, the name is no longer reserved and becomes open to the public to register.

To extend your domain registration, take these steps:

1. On the **My domains** tab, select the domain name that you want to extend.
2. Click **Manage** to open the domain management page.
3. Click **Extend**.
4. Select the number of years you want to extend this domain for:
   * For regular and protected domains, you can extend for any number of years.
   * For auctioned domains, extension is possible for up to 3 years at a time. For example, if you just won an auctioned name, it comes with a free 1-year renewal. You can extend this registration for another 2 years, to the total of 3 years.
5. Review the total fee:
   * For regular and protected domains, the total fee includes only the renewal fee for the requested period.
   * For auctioned domains, the total fee consists of the renewal fee and a tax that depends on the domain price.
6. Sign the transaction to make payment.
