## Overview

This guide shows how to register a protected `.ron` domain name.

Protected names are reserved by Sky Mavis for its official partners and key community members, and aren't available to anyone else. Such names have the status **Protected** in the RNS app.

Protected RNS names offer direct support from Sky Mavis to prevent anyone from squatting or misusing your name. Their renewal fees are fixed and not affected by the market.

If you are an official partner or key community member, we may have reserved your RNS name. To claim it, follow the steps in this guide.

:::caution
As long as the owner does not sell or transfer their RNS name to another wallet, the name and its yearly fee are protected. If the name is sold or transferred, it is no longer protected, but the renewal fee remains unchanged.

## Before you start

Before registering a regular domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

1. Select the number of years you want to register the domain for (1). The renewal fee changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. Notice that the name is set as primary by default (2), which means that it's linked to your Ronin address.
:::tip
We recommend registering your RNS name for multiple years so that you don't lose the domain name if you forget to renew or if you run into any potential payment issues.
:::
1. Click **Confirm** and pay the renewal fee to register the domain.
