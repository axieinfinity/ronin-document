## Overview

This guide shows how to register a new `.ron` domain name for your Ronin address.

In Ronin Name Service (RNS), regular names are available on a first-come, first-served basis with a yearly renewal fee that depends on the domain name's length. Regular names have the status **Available** in the RNS app.

### Renewal fee

Following is the renewal fee range for regular RNS names.

| Name length | Renewal fee |
|---|---|
| 5+ characters | $5/year |
| 4 characters | $100/year |
| 3 characters | $300/year |

### Naming guidelines

Following are the guidelines to be observed when choosing an RNS name:

* Domains can contain the English-language letters a-z, and the digits 0-9.
* Hyphens can also be used but not at the beginning and at the end of a domain name. Two hyphens together aren't permitted either.
* The minimum length is 3 characters.
* Domain names are case-sensitive and can only contain lowercase letters.
* Domain names cannot be related to Sky Mavis products (such as `axieinfinity.ron`) and trademarks (unless you pass trademark verification).

## Before you start

Before registering a regular domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

## Register a regular domain

1. At the request transaction, select the number of years you want to register the domain for (1).
:::tip
We recommend registering your RNS name for multiple years so that you don't lose the domain name if you forget to renew or if you run into any potential payment issues.
:::
The renewal fee changes based on how many years you want to register the domain for. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. **Note:** This name is *set as primary* by default (2), which means that it's linked to your Ronin address.
