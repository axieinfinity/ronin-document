## Overview

This guide shows how to register a new `.ron` domain name for your Ronin address.

In Ronin Name Service (RNS), regular names are available at a first-come, first-serve basis with a yearly renewal fee, which is based on the domain name's length. Regular names have the status **Available** in the RNS app.

### Renewal fee

Following is the renewal fee range for regular RNS names.

| Name length | Renewal fee |
|---|---|
| 5+ characters | $5/year |
| 4 characters | $100/year |
| 3 characters | $300/year |

### Naming guidelines

Following are the guidelines to be observed when choosing an RNS name:

* Domains can contain the English-language letters a-z, and the digits 0-9.
* Hyphens can also be used but not at the beginning and at the end of a domain name. Two hyphens together are not permitted either.
* The minimum length is 3 characters.
* Domain names are case-sensitive and can only contain lowercase letters.
* Domain names cannot be related to Sky Mavis products (such as `axieinfinity.ron`) and trademarks (unless you pass trademark verification).

## Before you start

Before registering a regular domain, install [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) and create an account.

## Register a regular domain

1. Open the RNS app.
2. Search for the domain you want to register. If it's already registered by someone else, try [making an offer](./../trade.md#make-an-offer) to the owner.
3. Click the domain name to open its info dialog. The dialog displays the renewal fee.
4. Select the number of years you want to register the domain for. The renewal fee changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year. Notice that the name is set as primary by default, which means that it's linked to your Ronin address.
:::tip
We recommend registering your RNS name for multiple years so that you don't lose the domain name if you forget to renew or if you run into any potential payment issues.

5. Click **Request** and wait for a few seconds to confirm your request. As soon as it's confirmed, your domain is ready to be registered.
6. Click **Confirm** and pay the renewal fee to register the domain.

After the registration is complete, your RNS domain name is ready for use across the entire Ronin ecosystem.
