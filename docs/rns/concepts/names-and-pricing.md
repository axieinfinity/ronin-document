| Auctioned | Starting domain price: 1-year renewal fee converted to RON using a 30-days moving average. Yearly renewal fee: $5/$100/$300 for 5+/4/3-character names, respectively. | Buy at auction in the RNS app. The owner is the one who places the highest bid. The minimum markup between two bids is 10% of the starting price per a 30-days moving average. | Free first-year renewal fee. The winner can own the name for up to 3 years. The owner has to pay domain tax when renewing after expiration. The price is updated per the valid highest offer or sale on Mavis Market. The price decreases 5% if no offer made within 3 months. |
| Protected | No tax/domain price. Yearly renewal fee: fixed.                                                                                                                       | Provide wallet address to Sky Mavis, then connect the wallet to self-register the name in the RNS app.                                                                     | Direct support to register domain names after verification. The yearly renewal fee is fixed and can be any amount. The name and its yearly fee are protected as long as the owner doesn't sell the name or transfer to another wallet. If they do, the name is no longer protected—it becomes a regular name where the yearly fee is charged per the name length.                            |
