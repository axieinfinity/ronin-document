## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to trade RNS names with other users on Mavis Market.

## Sell

### List for sale on Mavis Market

You can list your domain on Mavis Market at a fixed price, choose the duration of the sale, and set the price. After you entered the necessary information, click **List** to complete your listing.

If the owner listed a domain on Mavis Market and the listed price exceeds the current domain price, then when another user buys the domain, the domain price is set to the listed price (also known as the last sales price).

Mavis Market charges a 2.5% commission for a successful sale. For example, if someone buys your domain at a listed price of 100 RON, you receive 97.5 WRON.

### Edit your listing

Need to make a change to your listing? The only way to do that is to cancel it and submit a new listing.

### Accept an offer

When someone makes an offer on your listing, you can view the list of offers that are made. To accept an offer, click **Accept** on the offer you wish to accept. As a reminder, you can only receive payment with WRON, not RON.

## Buy

### Make an offer

Every domain that is registered for the first time (minted) can be searched on Mavis Market.

If you want to purchase an RNS domain registered by someone else, you can make an offer to the owner. Enter the amount of WETH or WRON (wrapped token) you wish to offer, and select the duration of the offer.

### Cancel an offer

Made an offer, but changed your mind? You can cancel your offer anytime by clicking **Cancel offer**.
