## Overview

This guide shows how to register a new `.ron` domain name for your Ronin address.

In Ronin Name Service (RNS), regular names have $0 domain price and are available at a first-come, first-serve basis with a yearly renewal fee. Regular names are labeled as **Available** in the RNS app.

## Before you start

### Ronin Wallet

Before registering a regular domain, make sure your Ronin Wallet is set up.

### Naming guidelines

Your RNS name must be over three characters long and contain only alphanumeric characters. That means letters from A to Z and numbers from 0 to 9.

## Register a regular domain

1. Open the RNS app.
2. Search for the domain you want to register. If it's already registered by someone else, try [making an offer](./../trade.md#make-an-offer) to the owner.
3. Click the domain name. You can see the domain price and yearly renewal fee, as well as past activities with this domain name.
4. Click **Register now** to begin registration. The registrar requires two transactions to register a domain name: request and registration.
5. At the request transaction, select the number of years you want to register this domain for. The price changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year.
6. Enable **Set as primary name** to link this domain to your Ronin address. For more information, see [Set as primary name](./../manage.md#set-primary-rns-name).
7. Click **Request**, which prompts the request transaction. It takes a few moments to confirm your request. As soon as it's confirmed, your domain is ready to be registered.
8. Click **Confirm** and pay the fee to register your domain.

After the registration transaction is complete, your RNS domain name is ready to use.
