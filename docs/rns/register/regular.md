## Overview

This guide shows how to register a regular RNS domain. A regular domain name is any unregistered domain that's marked as **Available** in the RNS app.

## Before you start

* Make sure your Ronin Wallet is connected.
* Learn how the renewal fee is calculated.

## Register a free domain

1. Open the RNS app.
2. Search for a domain that has the status **Available**.
3. Click the domain name to open its info page. The page displays the domain price and yearly renewal fee, as well as past activities with this domain name.
4. Click **Register now** to begin registration. The registrar requires two transactions to register a domain name: request and registration.
5. At the request transaction, select the number of years you want to register this domain for. The price changes based on how many years you selected. The minimum duration for the registration is 1 year.
6. Click **Request**, which prompts a transaction. It takes a few moments to confirm your request. As soon as it's confirmed, your domain is ready to be registered.
7. Click **Confirm** and pay the fee to register your domain.

After the registration transaction is complete, this RNS domain name is yours.
