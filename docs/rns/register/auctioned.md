## Overview

This guide shows how to register an *auctioned* RNS name. Auctioned RNS names are unregistered names that may receive large amounts of interest, such as buy.ron and insurance.ron. Sky Mavis distributes such names at domain auctions.

To participate in a domain auction, you and other participants need to place a bid. The winner of an auction is the one whose bid is the highest at the time the auction ends. The winner gets the domain and is exempt from paying renewal fee for the first year. After winning the name, the owner can extend it for one or more years under the same conditions as regular domains. If during an auction, someone outbids you, then your bid is immediately refunded and you can place another bid until the auction ends. 

:::info Minimum bid
How much to bid is at your discretion, but there's a minimum markup of 10%, which means 10% of the starting price if you're the first bidder or 10% of the highest bid if you're not. For example, if the starting price is 5 RON, then your bid has to be least 5 RON + 10% of 5 RON = 5,5 RON.

Auctioned names are marked as **Auctioning** in the RNS app.

## Register an auctioned name

1. Open the RNS app.
2. Search for the domain you want to register.
3. Click the domain name to open its info page. The page displays the starting price of the domain as well as the current highest bid with the history of past bids.
4. Click **Place a bid** to participate in the auction.
5. Enter your bid amount and click **Place a bid** to make payment.

Your bid is now placed and locked until the auction ends. If you win the auction, your bid is transferred to the RNS registrar and you become the owner of the domain name.
