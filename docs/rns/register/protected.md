## Overview

This guide shows how to register a protected `.ron` domain name for your business.

Protected names are reserved by Sky Mavis for its official partners and key community members, and aren't available to anyone else. Such names are labeled as **Protected** in the RNS app.

A protected name offers direct support from Sky Mavis to get your trademark (TM) reserved. This also helps prevent anyone from squatting or misusing your name. The domain price for protected names is fixed and is not affected by Mavis Market.

If you're our official partner or a key community member, it's likely that we already reserved a name you. To claim this reserved name, you need to complete trademark verification, and then register the name.

## Before you start

Before registering a protected domain, make sure your Ronin Wallet is set up.

## Complete trademark verification

This section explains how to verify your trademark to request for RNS name protection.

1. Open the RNS app.

4. Click **Contact us**.
5. Send us an email containing proof of trademark ownership.

After the trademark verification is complete, the domain name is mapped to your Ronin Wallet address.
