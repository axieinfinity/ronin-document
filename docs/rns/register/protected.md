## Overview

This guide shows how to claim a *protected* RNS domain name. Protected names are reserved by Sky Mavis for its official partners and some key community members, and aren't available to anyone else.

So if you're our official partner or a key community member, then it's likely that we already reserved a name you. What you need to do is contact us to verify that you're the entity behind the reserved name, and then register the name in the RNS app.

Protected names have the status **Protected** in the RNS app.

## Before you start

* Have your Ronin Wallet ready.
* Learn about pricing for protected domains.

## Verify your identity 

This section explains how to verify that you're the entity behind the reserved name.

1. Open the RNS app.
2. Search for the domain you want to register.
3. Click the domain name to open its info page. The page displays the domain price and yearly renewal fee, as well as past activities with this domain name.
4. Click **Contact us**.
5. Send us an email containing proof of your identity as our official partner or a key community member.

After the verification is complete, this domain name is mapped to your Ronin Wallet address.

## Register your protected domain

This section explains how to register your protected name in the RNS app.
