## What is RNS

The Ronin Name Service (RNS) is a distributed naming system based on the Ronin blockchain that lets you assign a human-readable name with a `.ron` domain to your long and opaque Ronin address.

By using the RNS name instead of the Ronin address, you can send funds and NFTs to a human-readable name vs. the long string of numbers and characters that you've been using to this day.

* **Turn this:** `ronin:41d8cf42236be14cc7b0c0df519a95822d7ad423`
* **Into this:** `kingofthepirates.ron`

RNS is integrated with Ronin Wallet, Sky Mavis Account service, App.Axie, Mavis Market, Origins, Homeland, and other apps in the Sky Mavis ecosystem.

That means your `.ron` name becomes your unique callsign throughout our entire ecosystem. So remember to choose a good name!

## RNS name categories

There are four categories of domain names in RNS:

### Blacklisted names

These are RNS names with negative connotations, sensitive themes, or deceptive potential that are not for sale. An example of a blacklisted name would be freeaxies.ron because it can be used to mislead the Axie community. Sky Mavis prohibits the creation of RNS names like these to protect our communities from bad actors.

### Protected names

These are RNS names that we’ve reserved for our official partners and some key community members. For example, Sky Mavis makes sure that battlebears.ron is not available to anyone—except the Battle Bears team. Again, this protects our communities from bad actors.

### Auctioned names

These are high-demand RNS names that may receive large amounts of interest, such as buy.ron and insurance.ron. Sky Mavis distributes such names during an auction as a means to generate revenue for RNS and reduce domain name squatting.

### Regular names

These are all of the other names. They're available on a first-come, first-served basis with a yearly renewal fee.

## RNS naming guidelines

RNS names must be over three characters long and contain only alphanumeric characters. That means letters from A to Z and numbers from 0 to 9.
