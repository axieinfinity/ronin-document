## Overview

Ronin Name Service (RNS) is a distributed naming system based on the Ronin blockchain that lets you assign a human-readable `.ron` domain name to your long Ronin address:

* **Turn this:** `ronin:41d8cf42236be14cc7b0c0df519a95822d7ad423`
* **Into this:** `kingofthepirates.ron`

By using the RNS name instead of the Ronin address, you can send funds and NFTs to a human-readable name vs. the long string of numbers and characters. A `.ron` domain name is your unique callsign throughout our entire ecosystem: RNS is integrated with Ronin Wallet, Sky Mavis Account service, App.Axie, Mavis Market, Origins, Homeland, and other apps.

## Name categories

There are four categories of domain names in RNS:

* **Blacklisted names:** These are RNS names with negative connotations, sensitive themes, or deceptive potential that are not for sale. An example of a blacklisted name would be freeaxies.ron because it can be used to mislead the Axie community. Sky Mavis prohibits the creation of RNS names like these to protect our communities from bad actors.
* **Protected names:** These are RNS names that we’ve reserved for our official partners and some key community members. For example, Sky Mavis makes sure that battlebears.ron is not available to anyone—except the Battle Bears team. Again, this protects our communities from bad actors.
* **Auctioned names:** These are high-demand RNS names that may receive large amounts of interest, such as buy.ron and insurance.ron. Sky Mavis distributes such names during an auction as a means to generate revenue for RNS and reduce domain name squatting.
* **Regular names:** These are all of the other names. They're available on a first-come, first-served basis with a yearly renewal fee.

## Pricing

The price of an RNS domain name depends on the following factors:

* **Domain price:** $0 for regular and protected names. Auctioned domains are priced by the market during auctions.
* **Renewal fee:** A fee charged for the registration duration, in years. This is a fixed fee based on the domain name's length. Shorter names are more expensive than longer ones.
* **Tax**: 15% of the domain price. This tax applies only to auctioned names and is charged if you renew your domain name after it expires.
