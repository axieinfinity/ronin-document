## Overview

Slashing is a mechanism that governs the behavior of validators and bridge operators on
the Ronin blockchain. This page describes the slashing rules for bridge operators. 

:::note 
A "day" in the slashing rules refers to the period
from midnight to midnight UTC.

## Unavailability bridge operator

The system slashes bridge operators for not providing enough signatures.
This is checked against a smart contract that records the
number of the bridge operators' votes.

### Tier 1 operator slashing

If a bridge operator misses more than 10% votes in a day,
the operator doesn't earn the bridge reward on that day.
The operator's status is set to **Punished**.

### Tier 2 operator slashing

If a bridge operator misses more than 30% votes in a day, the operator doesn't
earn any rewards for the next 5 days.
The operator's status is set to **Punished**.
