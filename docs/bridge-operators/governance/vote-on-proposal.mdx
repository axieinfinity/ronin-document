## Overview

As a bridge operator, you can vote on proposals created by other
bridge operators.

A proposal's approval or rejection is determined by the following ratio:
* A proposal is approved if it receives the approval of at least 70%
of the bridge operators.
* A proposal is rejected if at least 30% of the
bridge operators reject it.

If a proposal is neither approved nor rejected within 14 days,
it is automatically closed.

## Vote on a proposal

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your bridge operator address.
2. Select **Proposals**, and then choose **Approve** or **Reject**.
3. Confirm your decision and sign the transaction.
