## Overview

This guide explains how to create a proposal as a bridge operator.

## Create a proposal

1. Log in to [Validator Dashboard](https://validator.roninchain.com)
using your bridge operator address.
1. Select **Proposals** > **Add a proposal**.
:::info
The system allows for only one active proposal at a time.
If you see an existing active proposal, you need to wait until it's
closed. If a proposal doesn't get enough votes within 14 days, it's
closed automatically.
:::
1. Select the type of proposal you want
1. Sign the transaction to submit the proposal.

Your proposal is now displayed on the **Ongoing** tab, and will remain
active until [voted on](vote-on-proposal.mdx) by the other bridge operators or 
automatically close after 14 days.
