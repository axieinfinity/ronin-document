title: Bridge operator governance
---

Ronin's governance process is conducted via a decentralized voting
mechanism. Each bridge operator has a corresponding bridge operator
address. 

Bridge operators can propose and vote on the following types of changes:

* Pause the bridge
* Add bridge operators
* Remove bridge operators

A bridge operator creates a new proposal
for other operators to vote on. If at least 70% of the
operators approve the proposal, the change is applied.

The governance voting method is serial by design: only one governance
vote can be held at a time, and that vote must be completed before moving
to a new vote.
