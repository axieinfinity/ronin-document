# Claim your rewards

## Types of rewards

As a validator, you can earn three types of rewards:
* **Bridge rewards.** Rewards received for verifying transactions via Ronin Bridge. 
* **Commission.** Rewards derived from the block rewards times the commission rate.
* **Staking rewards.** Rewards derived from your self-stake and divided proportionally with your delegators.

## Claim commission and bridge rewards
Commission and bridge rewards are transferred to you automatically at the end of each period (roughly at the end of each day), so no action is required from your side.

## Claim staking rewards
Staking rewards are calculated each period (roughly equal to one day) and displayed as “claimable rewards”. You need to claim these rewards manually.

To claim, follow these steps:
1. On the **My Staking** page, click **Claim all**.
