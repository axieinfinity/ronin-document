# Claim your rewards

## Commission and bridge rewards
Commission and bridge rewards are transferred to you automatically at the end of each period (roughly at the end of each day), so you don’t need to claim them manually.

## Staking rewards
Staking rewards are calculated each period (roughly equal to one day) and displayed as “claimable rewards”.

To claim your staking rewards, follow these steps:
1. Go to **My Staking > Claim all**.
