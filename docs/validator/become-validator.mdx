# Become a validator

This page explains how to become a validator on the Ronin network.

## Validator roles

There are three validator roles:
* **Validator Candidate.** After following the steps in this guide, you'll become a Validator Candidate and have a chance to be selected as a Standard Validator on the next day.
* **Standard Validator.** Every day, at least 10 Validator Candidates with the highest amount staked are selected as Standard Validators. The system records your total staking amount at 00:00 UTC every day for the selection process. 
* **Governing Validator.** The validators chosen by the community and Sky Mavis to ensure network security. Governing Validators are validators by default, and they account for more than half of the total validator pool.

## Steps

1. Go to the [staking dashboard](https://saigon-staking.roninchain.com/) and click **Become a validator**.
