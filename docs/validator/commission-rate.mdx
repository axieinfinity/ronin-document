# Change commission rate
When registering to become a validator, you were asked to set a commission rateâ€”the percentage of block rewards you receive before distributing the rest to your delegators.

You can change the commission rate as many times as you like.

To change the commission rate, follow these steps:
1. Go to **My Profile > Commission rate**.

2. Enter the new commission rate and set the date when it takes effect. The date must be set at least seven days from the current date.

After you save the new rate, a clock icon is displayed next to your current rate to inform the community of the upcoming change.
