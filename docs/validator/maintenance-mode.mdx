# Schedule maintenance mode
When running a node, you might need to put it in maintenance mode at a scheduled time. This feature is available only to standard validators and governing validators.

:::note

There can be up to three validators scheduling maintenance mode at a time. If youâ€™re unable to schedule yours, check with the other validators when their maintenance mode ends.

:::

To schedule maintenance, follow these steps:
1. Go to **My Profile > Maintenance mode** and specify the duration of the maintenance period in epochs. The valid duration is 1-144 epochs (~10 minutes to ~24 hours), where 1 epoch equals 200 blocks. You can choose from the valid start epoch, then decide on the end epoch.

2. After you submit the request, the system displays your maintenance time, status, and estimated time until the maintenance period starts or ends.
