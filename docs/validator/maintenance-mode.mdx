# Schedule maintenance mode
When running a node, you might need to put it in maintenance mode at a scheduled time.

:::note

This feature is only available to Standard Validators and Governing Validators.

:::

1. Go to **My Profile > Maintenance mode**.

2. Specify the duration of the maintenance period in epochs. The valid duration is 1-144 epochs (~10 minutes to ~24 hours), where 1 epoch equals 200 blocks. You can choose from the valid start epoch, then decide on the end epoch.

3. After you submit the request, the system displays your maintenance time, status, and estimated time until the maintenance period starts or ends.

:::caution

There can be up to three validators scheduling maintenance mode at a time. If youâ€™re unable to schedule, check with the other validators when their maintenance mode ends.
