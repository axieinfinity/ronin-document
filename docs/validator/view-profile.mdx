If you’re a Standard Validator or a Validator Candidate, your profile has a set of three different addresses:

* **Admin address.** The address to manage your profile, staking activities, and claiming rewards.
* **Validator address.** The address used for minting blocks. This address is displayed to delegators and also called “consensus address”.
* **Bridge operator address.** The address used for operating Ronin Bridge.

If you’re a Governing Validator, your profile has an additional two addresses:
* **Chain governor address.** The address used to create proposals and vote for changes.
* **Bridge voter address.** The address used for syncing the set of bridge operators.
